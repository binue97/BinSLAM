# BinSLAM

BinSLAM is a Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system implementation that aims to perform real-time camera pose estimation and 3D mapping.

## Overview

This project implements a Visual SLAM system with the following features:

- Feature detection and tracking
- Camera pose estimation
- 3D map point generation
- Loop closure detection
- Bundle adjustment optimization

## Thirdparty libs
- OpenCV: 4.4.0
- Eigen: 3.3.9
